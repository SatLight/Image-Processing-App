## Abstract
Image Editing is an intense process that involves various operations such
as color correction by using different color enhancement methods like
contrast enhancing, image negative etc. Image resizing is implemented
by changing style elements (Height and width) of an image, Image
cropping by use of non-rectangular matrix or picture frame for selection
of portions, Image flipping by flipping an image at horizontal or vertical
axis and Image blurring by Gaussian Algorithm. It’s obvious that these
are all a part of creative methods that can edit your images in a simple
manner. Hence it is convenient to customers from different industries to
share one single environment for editing images.

## Introduction

Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image,
in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information
from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image and
output may be image or characteristics/features associated with that
image. Nowadays, image processing is among rapidly growing
technologies. It forms core research area within engineering and
computer science disciplines too.
Image processing basically includes the following three steps:

 Importing the image via image acquisition tools;

 Analyzing and manipulating the image;

 Output in which result can be altered image or report that is based
on image analysis.

There are two types of methods used for image
processing namely, analogue and digital image processing. Analogue
image processing can be used for the hard copies like printouts and
photographs. Image analysts use various fundamentals of interpretation
while using these visual techniques. Digital image processing techniques
help in manipulation of the digital images by using computers. The three
general phases that all types of data have to undergo while using digital
technique are pre-processing, enhancement, and display, information
extraction.

The user can do simple optimizations like changing hue, brightness, contrast, rotate image, crop etc.
